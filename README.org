* brltty-display-server

  a barebones JSON-RPC 2.0 server that provides a single =show= method
  that displays the input text onto a [[http://mielke.cc/brltty/doc/Manual-BrlAPI/English/BrlAPI-1.html][BrlAPI]]-compatible display.
  
  documentation on the python usage seems to be limited to [[https://github.com/brltty/brltty/blob/master/Bindings/Python/apitest.py][apitest.py]]
  from the official repository. That file also seems to demonstrate
  windows usage; this repository assumes linux.

  tested on =Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (bionic)= using =nix-env (Nix) 2.2.1=
  
* usage

  =nix-shell= into the environment and run:
  - =start-brltty= starts the brltty daemon
  - =start-receiver= starts the jsonprc server defined in
    [[file:receiver.py]]

  see [[file:example_transmitter.py]] for a minimal transmission request
